    <h1>Treatment</h1>
    <p>Although there's no cure for drug addiction, treatment options can help you overcome an addiction and stay drug-free.<br>
         Your treatment depends on the drug used and any related medical or mental health disorders you may have. Long-term follow-up is<br>
          important to prevent relapse.</p>

    <h1>Treatment programs</h1>
    <p>Treatment programs for substance use disorder usually offer:</p>    
    <p>Individual, group or family therapy sessions
    </p>  
    <p>A focus on understanding the nature of addiction,<br>
         becoming drug-free and preventing relapse</p>

    <p>Levels of care and settings that vary depending on your needs, such as outpatient, <br>
        residential and inpatient programs</p>   
        
        
    <h3>We know how hard this journey this is therapy to help you:</h3>
    <p>The goal of detoxification, also called "detox" or withdrawal therapy, <br>
        is to enable you to stop taking the addicting drug as quickly and safely as possible.<br>
         For some people, it may be safe to undergo withdrawal therapy on an outpatient basis. Others may need admission to a hospital or a residential treatment center.

    </p>  
    
    <p>Withdrawal from different categories of drugs — such as depressants, stimulants or opioids — produces<br>
         different side effects and requires different approaches. Detox may involve gradually reducing the dose of the drug or temporarily substituting other substances, such as methadone, <br>
         buprenorphine, or a combination of buprenorphine and naloxone.</p>


     <h1>Medicine treatment</h1>
      <p>After discussion with you, your health care provider may recommend medicine as part of your treatment for opioid addiction. <br>
        Medicines don't cure your opioid addiction, but they can help in your recovery. These medicines can reduce your craving for opioids and may help you avoid relapse.<br>
         Medicine treatment options for opioid addiction may include buprenorphine, methadone, naltrexone, and a combination of buprenorphine and naloxone.</p>
         
         
    <h1>Behaviour therapy</h1> 
    <p>As part of a drug treatment program,<br>
         behavior therapy — a form of psychotherapy — can be done by a psychologist or psychiatrist, or you may receive counseling from a licensed alcohol and drug counselor.<br>
          Therapy and counseling may be done with an individual, a family or a group. The therapist or counselor can:</p>    

     <p>Help you develop ways to cope with your drug cravings</p> 
     <p>Suggest strategies to avoid drugs and prevent relapse
    </p>   
    <p>Offer suggestions on how to deal with a relapse if it occurs</p>
    <p>Talk about issues regarding your job, legal problems, and relationships with family and friends</p>
    <p>Include family members to help them develop better communication skills and be supportive</p> 
    <p></p>
