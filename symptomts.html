    <h1>These are some of te signs that you may have a drug problem</h1>
    <p>You keep taking a drug after it's no longer needed for a health problem</p>
    <p>You need more and more of a substance to get the same effects (called "tolerance"), and you can take more before you feel an effect.</p>
    <p>You feel strange when the drug wears off. You may be shaky, depressed, sick to your stomach, sweat, or have headaches.</p>
    <p> You may also be tired or not hungry. In severe cases, you could even be confused, have seizures, or run a fever.When the drug wears off</p>
    <p>You can't stop yourself from using the drug, even if you want to. You are still using it even though it's making bad things happen in your life, like trouble with friends, family, work, or the law</p>
    <p>You spend a lot of your time thinking about the drug: how to get more, when you'll take it, how good you feel, or how bad you feel afterward.
    </p>
    <p>You have a hard time giving yourself limits. You might say you'll only use "so much" but then can't stop and end up using twice that amount. Or you use it more often than you meant to</p>
    <p>You have a hard time giving yourself limits. You might say you'll only use "so much" but then can't stop and end up using twice that amount. Or you use it more often than you meant to</p>
    <p>You've begun having trouble doing normal daily things, like cooking or working.
    </p>
    <p>You drive or do other dangerous things (like use heavy machines) when you are on the drug</p>
    <p>You borrow or steal money to pay for drugs.</p>
    <p>You hide the drug use or the effect it is having on you from others.</p>
    <p>You're having trouble getting along with co-workers, teachers, friends, or family members. They complain more about how you act or how you've changed.</p>
    <p>You sleep too much or too little, compared with how you used to. Or you eat a lot more or a lot less than before.</p>
    <p>You look different. You may have bloodshot eyes, bad breath, shakes or tremors, frequent bloody noses, or you may have gained or lost weight.
    </p>
    <p>You have a new set of friends with whom you do drugs and go to different places to use the drugs</p>
    <p>You look in other people's medicine cabinets for drugs to take</p>
    <p>You take prescribed meds with alcohol or other drugs.

    <h1>Brain chemistry</h1>
    <p>Humans are biologically motivated to seek rewards.<br>
         Often, these rewards come from healthy behaviors.<br>
          When you spend time with a loved one or eat a delicious meal, your body releases a chemical called dopamine, which makes you feel pleasure. <br>
          It becomes a cycle; you seek out these experiences because they reward you with good feelings.</p>

          <p>Substances send massive surges of dopamine through your brain, too.<br>
             But instead of feeling motivated to do the things you need to survive (eat, work and spend time with loved ones), such massive dopamine levels can lead to damaging changes that affect your thoughts, feelings and behavior</p>
    <p>This can create an unhealthy drive to seek more <br>
        pleasure from the substance and less from more healthy experiences.</p>


     <p>Over time, the substances change your brain chemistry, and you become desensitized to their effects. <br>
        You then need more to produce the same effect.</p>
        
    <h1>Genetics</h1>
    <p>Studies show that genetic factors are responsible for 40% to 60% of the vulnerability to any substance use disorder.<br>
         If you have a first-degree relative (biological sibling or parent) with SUD, youâ€™re more likely to develop it.</p>

<h1>Mental health</h1>
<p>About half of people who experience a mental health condition will also experience a substance use disorder and vice versa.<br>
     This is known as a dual diagnosis. In 2020, 17 million U.S. adults had a co-occurring mental health disorder and SUD.</p>

<p>SUDs and other mental health conditions are caused by overlapping factors such as genetic vulnerabilities,<br>
     issues with similar areas of your brain and environmental influences.</p>     

<p>Research shows that mental illness may contribute to SUD, <p>
    
</p>and SUD can contribute to the development of mental illness.</p>
